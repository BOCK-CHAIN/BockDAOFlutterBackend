## API Integration

The web interface communicates with the ProjectX DAO API server. Key endpoints include:

### Proposals
- `GET /dao/proposals` - List all proposals
- `POST /dao/proposal` - Create new proposal
- `POST /dao/vote` - Cast vote on proposal

### Treasury
- `GET /dao/treasury` - Get treasury status
- `POST /dao/treasury/transaction` - Create treasury transaction
- `POST /dao/treasury/sign` - Sign treasury transaction

### Members
- `GET /dao/members` - List DAO members
- `GET /dao/member/:address` - Get member details
- `GET /dao/token/balance/:address` - Get token balance

### Real-time Events
- `WebSocket /dao/events` - Real-time DAO events

## Customization

### Styling
The interface uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #667eea;
  --secondary-color: #764ba2;
  --success-color: #28a745;
  --danger-color: #dc3545;
  --warning-color: #ffc107;
}
```

### Configuration
Update the API base URL in `js/dao-api.js`:

```javascript
class DAOAPI {
    constructor(baseURL = 'http://localhost:9000') {
        this.baseURL = baseURL;
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Development vs Production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This interface is designed for development and testing. For production use:

1. **Never expose private keys** in the browser
2. **Use proper wallet integrations** (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. **Implement proper authentication** and session management
4. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
5. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side

### Best Practices

- Always verify transaction details before signing
- Use hardware wallets for significant amounts
- Keep your private keys secure and never share them
- Regularly update your browser and wallet software
- Be cautious of phishing attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Failed**:
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
   - Check that you're on the correct network
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **API Errors**:
   - Verify the DAO server is running on port 9000
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured

3. **Transaction Failures**:
   - Check your token balance
   - Verify you have sufficient tokens for fees
   - Ensure the proposal/transaction is still active

4. **WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify WebSocket support in your browser
   - Try refreshing the connection

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening browser console and running:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('dao-debug', 'true');
```
